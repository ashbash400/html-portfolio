<p>For years we've talked about wanting to send open invites to all of our friends and family members for weekend trips like this, and we're finally doing it for Nicholas' 30th birthday! We'd love for you to join us on a ski/snowboarding trip to mark Nicholas' 30th year! We chose Heavenly Lake Tahoe because it has the largest variety of lodging options for everyone to choose what works best for them.</p>
