<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</h3>
<p>Not a single shot or line of dialogue is wasted in this cinematic masterpiece that harkens back to '80s and '90s adventure movies while being wonderfully clever.</p>
<h3>Pride & Prejudice (2005)</h3>
<p>My go to comfort film. It is a warm, cozy, delightful hug.</p>
<h3>The Mummy (1999)</h3>
<p>"I was just looking for a good time!" and that's what this film is. It knows was it is and it excels at it while delivering on all childhood Ashley's curly haired, librarian dreams.</p>
